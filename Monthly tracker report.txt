ðŸ“Š Monthly Tracker (Well Status Reporting)

This page provides a high-level compliance summary of wells, showing whether they have been completed or remain pending during the selected reporting period.

ðŸ”Ž Visual Overview

Date Slicer (Top Left): Filters results by the selected monitoring date range.
Well_ID Table (Left): Lists each well alongside its current status (Completed / Pending).
Pie Chart (Right): Displays the WellCount by Status, showing the proportion of completed vs. pending wells.

This layout gives both granular detail (well-level status) and a visual summary (status distribution).

ðŸ§® Calculated Columns & Measures

WellStatusLegend

WellStatusLegend = 
DATATABLE(
    "Status", STRING,
    {
        {"Completed"},
        {"Pending"}
    }
)


A static dimension table containing the two status categories: Completed and Pending.
Provides a clean reference for visuals like the pie chart and slicers.

WellCount

WellCount = 
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(WellStatusLegend[Status]),
    "Completed", [Completed Wells],
    "Pending", [Pending Wells]
)


Dynamically returns the number of wells by status:
If status = Completed â†’ returns [Completed Wells] measure.
If status = Pending â†’ returns [Pending Wells] measure.
Drives the pie chart visualization of well counts by category.

Status (per Well_ID)

Status = 
VAR _WellID = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Monthly_Tracking'[Well_ID] )
VAR _Match =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS( 'rolling_data' ),
        'rolling_data'[Well_ID] = _WellID
    )
RETURN
IF( _Match > 0, "Completed", "Pending" )


Assigns a status label for each well in the Monthly_Tracking table:
If the well has matching records in rolling_data â†’ Completed.
If no matching records are found â†’ Pending.
Populates the Well_ID vs. Status table in the report.
