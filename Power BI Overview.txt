# Power BI Reporting -- Arbor Hills Landfill Monitoring

To complement the CSV-to-Excel automation, a Power BI reporting layerwas developed. These reports provide visibility into well performance,compliance deadlines, and monthly monitoring outcomes.

## ðŸ”— Data Model Structure

The model consists of four main tables:

### Appended_Data

-   Contains the complete dataset appended from daily CSV uploads.
-   Includes raw and standardized parameters such as:
    -   Gas concentrations: CH4_Percent, CO2_Percent, O2_Percent,
        H2S_PPM
    -   Pressures & flows: Adj_Static_P, Adj_Flow, Init_Diff_P
    -   Temperatures: Init_Temperature_F, Final_Temperature_F,
        Meter_Temperature
    -   Operational metadata: Source_File, Technician, Instrument_ID,
        Site
-   Acts as the historical log, ensuring all readings are preserved and
    traceable.

### rolling_data

-   A refined dataset optimized for compliance and trend analysis.
-   Adds calculated and operational fields:
    -   5_day_due_date, 15_day_due_date -- Compliance deadlines
    -   Days_Out_of_Parameter -- Deviation tracker
    -   Resolved, Technician, Valve_Comment, Well_Comment -- Issue
        resolution metadata
-   Focused on KPIs that drive daily and rolling compliance dashboards.

### Monthly_Tracking

-   Designed for regulatory and month-by-month compliance review.
-   Stores well-level attributes and monthly performance:
    -   Monthly columns (Jan--Dec) for compliance notes.
    -   Well attributes: Well_ID, Well_Type, Wellhead_Size,
        Wellhead_Type, Location.
    -   Performance trackers: Completed_Wells, Pending_Wells, Status.
-   Supports management-level compliance summaries and monthly MOR
    reporting.

### WellStatusLegend

-   A small lookup/dimension table mapping:
    -   Status â†’ (e.g., Completed, Pending, Out of Compliance)
    -   WellCount â†’ Number of wells in that category.
-   Used to simplify status-based visuals like KPI cards, donut charts,
    and well status counts.


## ðŸ”— Relationships

-   **Appended_Data â†’ rolling_data (Many-to-One)**\
    Aligns raw readings with compliance-calculated rolling metrics.

-   **rolling_data â†’ Monthly_Tracking (Many-to-One)**\
    Connects daily/rolling data to structured monthly compliance logs.

-   **Monthly_Tracking â†’ WellStatusLegend (Many-to-One)**\
    Enables reporting of well completion status against predefined
    categories.

## ðŸ“ˆ Report Outputs

The Power BI dashboards built on this model include:

### Compliance Dashboard

-   Tracks wells approaching/exceeding 5_day_due_date and
    15_day_due_date.
-   Shows "Pending vs. Completed Wells" using the WellStatusLegend.

### Gas Composition & Trends

-   Line charts for methane (CH4%), oxygen, CO2, and H2S_PPM over time.
-   Identifies anomalies and wells exceeding thresholds.

### Pressure & Flow Insights

-   Monitoring of Adj_Static_P, Adj_Flow, and differential pressures.
-   Detects system imbalances and operational issues.

### Monthly Tracking & MOR Alignment

-   Tables summarizing well activity by month (Jan--Dec).
-   Integrated with fields like Completed_Wells, Pending_Wells, Status
    for regulatory submissions.

## ðŸš€ Key Value

-   **Operational Monitoring:** Detects compliance risks early (due
    dates, parameter exceedances).\
-   **Regulatory Reporting:** Provides ready-to-submit MOR summaries.\
-   **Transparency:** Links raw data (CSV â†’ Appended_Data) through
    compliance metrics (rolling_data) into monthly executive dashboards.
