📊 Exceedance Reporting (Power BI)

This visual provides a compliance tracker for landfill well monitoring, showing when each well reading goes out of parameter (e.g., negative pressure) and how long it remains non-compliant before resolution.

🔎 Visual Overview

Date Slicer (Top Left): Allows filtering of results by monitoring date range.
Main Table: Displays well-level details for compliance analysis, including:
Well_ID → Identifier of the monitored well.
Date → Timestamp of the monitoring record.
Parameter → Parameter being tracked (set to Pressure).
Value → Recorded pressure value.
Compliance Date → The next monitoring date when the well comes back into compliance.
Resolved → Indicates whether the well was later resolved (Yes/No).
5_day_due_date → Five-day compliance deadline based on the initial reading date.
15_day_due_date → Extended 15-day compliance deadline.
Days_Out_of_Parameter → Number of days the well remained non-compliant.

This view enables operators to quickly see which wells are out of compliance, how long they have been out, and whether corrective action was taken.

🧮 Calculated Columns Used

15_day_due_date
15_day_due_date = 'rolling_data'[Date] + 15

Adds 15 days to the monitoring date to set the regulatory deadline for compliance.


5_day_due_date
5_day_due_date = 'rolling_data'[Date] + 5

Adds 5 days to the monitoring date, representing a short-term follow-up deadline.

Compliance Date

Compliance Date = 
VAR currWell = 'rolling_data'[Well_ID]
VAR currDate = 'rolling_data'[Date]
RETURN
CALCULATE (
    MIN ( 'rolling_data'[Date] ),
    FILTER (
        ALL ( 'rolling_data' ),
        'rolling_data'[Well_ID] = currWell &&
        'rolling_data'[Date] > currDate &&
        'rolling_data'[Init_Static_P] < 0
    )
)
Finds the earliest future reading date for the same well (currWell) where Init_Static_P is below 0 (indicating restored compliance).

Days_Out_of_Parameter

Days_Out_of_Parameter = 
DATEDIFF ( 'rolling_data'[Date], 'rolling_data'[Compliance Date], DAY )

Calculates the number of days a well remained out of compliance before the issue was resolved.



Parameter
Parameter = "Pressure"
Hardcoded label so reports can clearly state which parameter the exceedance calculation is tracking.

Resolved
Resolved = 
VAR currWell = 'rolling_data'[Well_ID]
VAR currDate = 'rolling_data'[Date]
RETURN
IF (
    CALCULATE (
        COUNTROWS ( 'rolling_data' ),
        FILTER (
            'rolling_data',
            'rolling_data'[Well_ID] = currWell &&
            'rolling_data'[Date] > currDate &&
            'rolling_data'[Init_Static_P] < 0
        )
    ) > 0,
    "Yes",
    "No"
)


Flags the reading as “Yes” if future monitoring data shows the well came back into compliance (pressure < 0).

Otherwise marked “No”, meaning the exceedance is unresolved.
